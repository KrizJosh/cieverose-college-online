    <h2>Advanced routing configuration</h2>
    <p>
      Vercel gives you a variety of ways to configure the routing of your
      website. For example, adding redirects, rewrites, or headers to your page.
      While you can use <code>vercel.json</code> to define these through JSON,
      you can also express your routing configuration as code using
      <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-middleware"
        >Vercel Edge Middleware</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Middleware runs before the
      <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/edge-network/caching"
        >Vercel Edge Network Cache</a
      >, so you can configure routing exactly as your application needs. For
      example, this template uses <code>middleware.js</code> defined in the root
      of the repository to add additional security headers to the site:
    </p>
    <pre><code>referrer-policy: origin-when-cross-origin
strict-transport-security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
x-content-type-options: nosniff
x-dns-prefetch-control: on
x-frame-options: DENY</code></pre>
